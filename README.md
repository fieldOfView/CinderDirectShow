### DirectShow video for Cinder 

A proof of concept video player that uses DirectShow (and more specifically the VMR-9 renderer) to render the video, and creates an OpenGL texture from the Direct3d9 texture that VMR-9 produces. Hopefully it will grow into a block at some point, providing a viable alternative for Quicktime for Windows. 

The code is mostly based on the custom Allocator/Presenter sample provided in the Microsoft Windows SDK
